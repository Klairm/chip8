# chip8 PS4
Chip8 interpreter in C++ ported to PS4 

A simple Chip8 interpreter written in C++ for educational purposes

## TODO:
- Read ROMs from USB ( should be easy to implement )
- Optimize switch hell
- Clean code ( it's fucking mess ) ( for real I need to clean this)

## Usage
Select the ROM in the menu with X ,roms are stored in /app0/assets/misc/, then connect a keyboard to the PS4 and have fun

(yes you need to connect a keyboard to your PS4, lol)
